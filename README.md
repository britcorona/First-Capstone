# NNS First-Capstone

###Know Thy Car

This app is for viewing car part prices for the cars provided, and keeping a vehicle service checklist.

###Running the application

#####Clone the repo https://github.com/britcorona/First-Capstone.git

#####Install the HTTP Server

*Only install if you have not already globally installed the server*

The http-server module is just a very basic project that will serve static files from the directory of your choice.

sudo npm install -g http-server

#####Serve the application

Next, you go to the First-Capstone application root folder and start the server.

http-server

http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port it reports it is using) will display the application.

#####Install Bower

Go to the lib folder and *bower install*

#####Install Grunt

Still in the lib folder *npm install*

Now that everything is installed, make sure **Grunt** is running in the lib folder and the **http-server** is running in the applications *root folder*, and view the Music History webpage.
